## Principle of the game :
The principle of the game is quite simple, it's a two-player game, initially there are <u>21</u> matches which are laid out on a table.
In turn, you will have to remove one, two or three matches.
BUT BE CAREFUL, whoever removes the last match from the table loses!
<u>It's up to you to develop the best strategy to win!</u>
