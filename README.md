## Principle of the game :
The principle of the game is quite simple, it's a two-player game, initially there are 21 matches which are laid out on a table.
In turn, you will have to remove one, two or three matches.
BUT BE CAREFUL, whoever removes the last match from the table loses!
It's up to you to develop the best strategy to win!
