## Principle of the game :
The principle of the game is quite simple, it's a two-player game, initially there are 21 matches which are laid out on a table.
In turn, you will have to remove one, two or three matches.
BUT BE CAREFUL, whoever removes the last match from the table loses!
It's up to you to develop the best strategy to win!

In case of problems, you can directly access the rules of the game in the home page of the game:

## Games Modes :
The game offers several different game modes whether you are alone or two:
- ### Player vs. Player :
You can take turns playing with a friend! The first player will be "Player 1" and the second "Player 2".
- ### Player vs. Computer (random) :
- ### Player vs. Computer (algorithmic) :
- ### Computer vs. Computer (random) :


## Technologies used :
I use two very useful and functional modules:
- [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
to completely randomly generate the number of matches taken by the computers.
- [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/tk.html)
to create the full GUI! All actions with buttons, animations,...
- [PYinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)
to compact all the external files in the same executable file, this module also allows to run any python program (even with dependencies) on any machine!


## Downloads :
